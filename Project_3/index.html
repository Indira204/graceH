  <h2> Fun Fact</h2>
  <img src="bug.jpeg" alt="" style="width:30%">
 <p> The term "debugging" used in the technology field originated because of Grace Hopper and the team she was working with on Mark I. The machine that they were working with was giving them trouble, so they decided to take a look at it. When they opened up the computer's hardware they found a moth. From then on the word bug was used to describe a computer glitch.</p>
